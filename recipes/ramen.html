    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Ramen noodle and broth dish inspired by the Japanese classic using
      ingredients commonly available in American supermarkets. Quite involved,
      but it has become one of my family's favorites, especially in cooler
      weather. Slurping is recommended.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 cups water</li>
      <li>8 cloves garlic, peeled and whole</li>
      <li>8 slices fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>Â½ medium onion, halved and separated</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine water, garlic, ginger, and onion in a large stock pot and bring
        broth base to a simmer. Reduce heat to maintain an easy simmer for 40
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While broth simmers, fill a saucepan with water. Bring to a boil and
        reduce heat to a simmer. Lower eggs into the water 1 at a time. Cook 7
        minutes for barely set yolks. Remove eggs from hot water, run under cold
        water until cool, and peel. Halve eggs lengthwise, place on a plate, and
        season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil in preparation for
        cooking noodles. Reduce heat to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a slotted spoon or long-handled strainer to remove garlic, ginger,
        and onion from the broth in the stock pot after it has simmered 40
        minutes. Discard vegetables. Add soy sauce, sake, chile sauce, sesame
        oil, sugar, and salt and stir well. Cover stock pot loosely and simmer
        10 to 20 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return simmering water to a boil. Add noodles and return to a boil. Cook
        noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet
        firm to the bite, 1 to 3 minutes. Drain and divide noodles between 4
        large bowls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add shrimp and scallops to the simmering broth. Cook until opaque, 3 to
        5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
